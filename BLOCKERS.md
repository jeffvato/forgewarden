# ForgeWarden Blockers

This file records only genuine blockers that require Customer Root authority, unavailable external resources, or a condition that makes further safe work impossible.

## Current blockers

None.

## What is not a blocker

The following do not justify stopping the swarm:

- a failing test;
- a reviewer finding;
- a need to refactor;
- a failed implementation approach;
- documentation that can be resolved from repository evidence;
- completion of the current task;
- the next task being difficult;
- ordinary model disagreement.

When these occur, investigate, repair, revalidate, or move to another independent READY task.

## Blocker record format

When a genuine blocker exists, record:

- Blocker ID
- Related task/requirement
- Exact condition
- Why work cannot continue safely
- What authority/resource/decision is required
- Independent READY work still available, if any
- Current commit/checkpoint
- First action to resume after resolution

Do not convert uncertainty into permission. If the issue is an authority boundary, fail closed and record it here.
